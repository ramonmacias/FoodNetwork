# FoodNetwork

FoodNetwork is an application that try to minimize as much as we can all the food waste in the city of Barcelona, I have been working
close to the Banc d'aliments de Barcelona, that is an Organization that try to minimize the lack of food in our region. The main function
of this organization is to gather all the aliments they need and be sure they can share all of this aliments with the people that really need it.

This is why we create this app that helps to all of us to put in this network all the aliments that we don't need or we want to donate, and a driver from banc d'aliments will come to your home and collect it, so with this app we can reduce the food waste and help to all this people that need food for eat.

This is my final project degree
